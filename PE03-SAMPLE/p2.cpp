 *  CS 150 PE03: INTERMEDIATE STRINGS/LOOPS
 *
 *  Given an input string, count the number of words ending 
 *  in 'y' or 'z' -so the 'y' in "heavy" and the 'z' in "fez" 
 *  count, but not the 'y' in "yellow". Make sure that your 
 *  comparison is not case sensitive. We'll say that a y 
 *  or z is at the end of a word if there is not an alphabetic 
 *  letter immediately following it. 
 *
 *  Do not use any string functions except for substr(), 
 *  at(), and size(). You may use isalpha from cctype as well.
 *
 *  This is the most difficult problem in the set,
 *  so do not start with this one.
 *  
 *  Here are some other examples:
 *      - "fez day" -> 2 
 *      - "day fez" -> 2 
 *      - "day fyyyz" -> 2
